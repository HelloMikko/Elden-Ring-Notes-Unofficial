This is where you can find notes, this is also collaborative.

 1. If you would like to contribute to these notes, which is very simple and easy, you can do so starting by heading to https://stackedit.io.
 2. Once you are there, look at the URL bar at the top:
![Be sure to click on INSTALL](https://i.imgur.com/veOrYgD.png)
if you already have this installed as a web application, you can ignore #2
3.  You will also want to have something your able to store and retrieve your notes from any time, especially if you want to share them with others. I find it easier to go ahead and use [Github](https://github.com) It is free for those who dont know what it is or have never used it, but its fairly simple and straight forward, you dont need to be a nerd to know how to use this. This can be extremally helpful to you for your future usage as well once you learn the basics.
4. Create a repository with any name others will be able to find it.
5. Open up your Stackedit web app from the window start menu or hold: `Window button & press S` a search box will appear and you can type in Stackedit.
6. Once its loaded up, head to the right side which is where your configured workspaces will be and you can add your Github Workspace. This is where all your notes of choice can be uploaded.

7. As you can see its fairly simple to fill in the blanks.

8.  You will only need the URL of your github which you can get from the url bar. You dont need to worry about the folder path of Branch unless you know what your doing and you like to keep things organized.
9. Add [Ephektiv/Elden-Ring-Notes-Unofficial at Contributed (github.com)](https://github.com/Ephektiv/Elden-Ring-Notes-Unofficial/tree/Contributed), upload your notes and initiate  a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Ephektiv/Elden-Ring-Notes-Unofficial/pulls)
Thats it, your done! We do appreciate your support and help with adding more and more notes of what we find from the game we love!
